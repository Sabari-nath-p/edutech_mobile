# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/mathlablogo.png
    - assets/image/splash1.png
    - assets/image/loginitem.png
    - assets/icons/home.svg
    - assets/icons/progess_icon.svg
    - assets/icons/class.svg
    - assets/icons/profile.svg
    - assets/icons/student_badge.png
    - assets/icons/video.svg
    - assets/icons/exam.svg
    - assets/image/questionbg.png
    - assets/image/base.png
    - assets/temp/temp1.png
    - assets/image/settings icon.svg
    - assets/image/messages icon.svg
    - assets/loading.json
    - assets/image/errorimage.png
    - assets/image/no_notification.jpg
    - assets/icons/logo.png
    - assets/icons/notification_pp.png
    - assets/icons/mathlab logo.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    - family: Mullish
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mulish/Mulish-VariableFont_wght.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
